# Skills

## Passive
The Ravager can jump off walls and charge these jumps to perform great leaps.
Also, melee hits fill up the Blood Well, healing him and empowering his skills for a short time when filled.

Empowered: Drag them along the ground after landing, dealing heavy damage over time and hitting enemies you pass through

If hitting a boss, instead punch them, firing a shockwave hitting enemies in a cone behind them
