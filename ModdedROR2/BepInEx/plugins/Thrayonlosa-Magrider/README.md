## Mechanics
- The Magrider does not have a free camera, instead you are locked to its yaw and roll, and only have limited pitch. Looking left or right will apply yaw to the vehicle, turning it and thus subsequently the camera.
- Hovers above the ground beneath its hull, including walls
- Its hull is much larger than normal surivors, small movements will not be enough to avoid attacks
- Side movement is weaker than forwards
- Has an afterburner as its main source of burst mobility

## Primary Cannons
- Its weapons are fixed turrets, meaning that the entire hull needs to be turned to facing the target to be able to shoot them.
- The weapons also have limited range, to encorage close ranged combat in a close ranged game.
- The Plasma Cannon fires an explosive shot every 1.5 seconds, with good radius and speed.
- The Perihelion Blaster sacrifices size, damage, and velocity in exchange for better reload speed and the ability to store up to 4 shots at once.
- Both weapons scale with attack speed.

## Magburner
- Hold down utility to gain a large boost to acceleration and top speed, at the cost of fuel.
- A full burst only lasts little more than a second, regenerates over 10 seconds, and has an activation cost.
- Fuel scales with utility cooldown and stock size.

## Recharge
- Upon use fully recharges your fuel and clears debuffs.
- Has a long cooldown.

## Jump
- Holding down jump will apply a force and torque in the world vertical direction.
- Useful for deflipping or scalling vertical walls.
- Jump force scales with Hopoo Feathers, torque scales with Wax Quails.
