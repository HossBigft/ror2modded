<br/>• Fixed an issue where your tank may freeze in the air.
<br/>• Fixed and optimized thruster velocity consistency.
<br/>• Fixed a small issue where mass was highlighted green for lighter weight and vice versa (colors are now swapped to proper).

<br/>![image](https://i.postimg.cc/FshXn8Kg/Tank-fix-picture.png)
<br/>• MAJOR FIX: Fixed a netcode issue when there was 3+ tanks in the game. Parties should no longer have great latency issues.
<br/>

<br/>• Bulldozer constant damage increased to 125% (from 100%).
<br/>• Grenade Launcher projectile gravity fixed.
<br/>• Piercing Cannon projectile slightly faster.
<br/>• Passive: Armor stat increased to 25 (from 15).
<br/>• Barreling impact damage now deals 250% (from 100%).
<br/>• Backup magazine effect nerfed for Minigun's overheat (from 100% to 33%).
<br/>• Flamethrower hitbox tripled.
<br/>• Max thrust strength for lighter builds slightly increased.
<br/>• Crash recovery is now a total of 0.55 seconds (from 1.25 seconds). Sliding while crashed is not affected.
<br/>• Hopoo feather + Wax Quail now give more fuel (30 -> 35; 20 -> 25).
<br/>• Corrected spelling/descriptions for the following: Missile Launcher; REIGN; Passive Armor.
<br/>• Descriptions for M2s/M4s affected by cooldown now list cooldowns. M2s now list accuracies and blast radius.
<br/>• Fixed REIGN not properly shooting projectiles when aimed to the sky.
<br/>• Fixed tank body/turret stats not showing on client-side (when host has not selected the tank).
<br/>• Added fall damage negation on successful stunts.

<br/>
<br/>Known issues within this patch:
<br/>• Excessive launch of thrust after properly landing a Super Jump.
<br/>• Tank freezes in place against walls and out of bounds, while still being "in the air" (caused by extreme high velocity).
<br/>• Goobo Jr. AI/Artifact of Vengeance AI not working properly.  (aka. being stupid)
<br/>• Thruster sound may still play in lobby after a run.  (Rare occurrence)

`1.0.3`

`1.0.2`
<br/>• Shotgun idle reload is now faster. (from 5 to 3 seconds)
<br/>• REIGN cooldown increased (from 25 to 30 seconds); damage increases slower overtime.

<br/>• Fixed bugs/exploits with passive selections.
<br/>• Fixed exploit with REIGN.
